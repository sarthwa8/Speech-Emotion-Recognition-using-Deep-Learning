🎤 Speech Emotion Recognition Web App
🔗 Built with TensorFlow, librosa, and Gradio

Developed an interactive web application that detects human emotions from speech using deep learning. The model classifies speech into 8 emotions — happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgust, calm, neutral, and surprised — by extracting MFCC features from audio and feeding them into a trained Keras model.

🔍 Key Features:

Real-time audio input via recording or upload

MFCC-based feature extraction using librosa

Emotion prediction with a custom-trained neural network

Smooth user interface using Gradio

🛠️ Tech Stack: Python · TensorFlow · Keras · librosa · Gradio · NumPy · scikit-learn

📊 Trained using emotional speech datasets like RAVDESS and TESS for diverse emotion coverage.
